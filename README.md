# Snake-Game
Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake and aims to eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and its own tail. This game is implemented using the C programming language, offering a simple and enjoyable gaming experience.

The player interacts with the game using keyboard inputs. The snake can be controlled to move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When the player presses a direction key, the snake moves in that direction and continues to move in the same direction until another direction key is pressed. The goal is to guide the snake towards the food, which, when eaten, causes the snake to grow longer by adding a new segment at its tail.

The Snake Game in C language can be implemented using various programming concepts, such as arrays to represent the game screen and the snake's body, loops for updating the game state, conditional statements for collision detection, and keyboard input handling using functions like getch() or library functions like conio.h to capture user inputs.

Overall, the Snake Game in C language is a fun and engaging project that showcases the implementation of game mechanics, user input handling, and visual representation using ASCII characters in a console-based environment. It offers an entertaining experience reminiscent of the classic arcade games, while also providing a learning opportunity for beginner programmers to practice their skills and understand basic game development concepts.
